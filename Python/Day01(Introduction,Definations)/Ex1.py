Case Sensitivity
When you apply the term "case-sensitive" to a string (which could consist of one or more characters), 
it means that such string can ONLY be equal to another string with the same characters
if each character in the first string is respectively in the SAME CASE with each character in the second string.


'''

"""
Let's see some examples:

a is EQUAL to a
X is NOT EQUAL to x ("X" different from "x")
Be Z is EQUAL to Be Z
bAM is NOT EQUAL to bAm ("M" different from "m")
programming language is NOT EQUAL to programming language ("L" different from "l")
Case-sensitive involves a strict check such that for both strings to be the same, it has to be equal, not just in the characters involved, but the casing of each character.
