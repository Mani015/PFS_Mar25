# What is Operator?
# Operatos are special type of symbols that perform on two operands(values) then return result.
# Examples : if you add two numbers 
# syntax : Operand1 + Operand2

a = 12
b = 5

# print(a + b)
# a is operand1
# b is operand2
#  + is operator

# In python , seven types of operators
# 1.Arthematic Operator
# 2.Assignment Operator
# 3.Comparision Operator
# 4.Logical Operator
# 5.Membership Operator
# 6.Identity Operator
# 7.Bitwise Operator


# 1.Arthematic Operator
# In Arthematic operator, we have different operators
# Addition +, Subtraction -, Multiplication *, Division /, Floor Division //, Moduls %,
# Exponentiation **

# Addition : Adding two or more numbers, It is denoted by + operator
v1 = 5
v2 = 4

# print(v1 + v2) 9

# Subtraction : To find out the difference between two values, it's denoted by - operator
# print(v1 - v2) 1

# Multiplication  : Operand1 multiply with operand2 , it return result , denoted by *
# print(v1 * v2) 20

# Division : operand1 is divide with operand2   '/'  then result it returns floating value

# print('Division : ',v1 / v2)
# 1.25


# Floor Division : operand1 is divide with operand2   '/'  then result it returns ignores floating value

# print('Floor Division : ',v1 // v2)
# Floor Division :  1

# Power  : It denoted by ** operator

# print(4 ** 2) 16
print(v1 ** v2)
# 625

# print(25 ** 2)  # 625


# Moduls : Modul's Takes remiander value
print(5 % 2) # 1

# 2 )   5  ( 2  -->coefficent  division, floor division(ignore float value)
#       4
#      ---
#       1  ----> Remiander
