# Python list and Numpy arrays
# 1.Similarities
# 2.Difference
# 3. Advantages of array

# 1.Similarities :
# a).Both can be used to store data
# b). Order will be preserve in both type.(we can access elements by using index)
# c). Slicing is also applicable for both
# d). Both are mutable, once we create list or array.


# 2.Difference
# a1). List is In-built data type but numpy array is not in-built, we have to install
# a2).We have to creating number of dimensions in numpy array, it is not possible to make Ndimension in list
# a3). List can hold hetrogenous (Multiple data types)
#        but Array can hold only homogenous element
# a4). On arrays we can perform vector operations like 1-D, 2-D, 3-D
# (the operation but we cannot perform vector operations on list).

# 3 . Advantage of Array
# a5). Array consuming less memory
# a6).Array super fast when compared with list.
# a7). Numpy array are more convienet to use while performing mathematical operations
