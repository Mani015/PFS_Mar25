# Polymorphism : One function can do more than one tasks.

s1 : str = "python"
l1 : list = [1,2,3]
st1 : set = {1,2,3,4,5}

print(len(s1)) # 6
print(len(l1)) # 3
print(len(st1)) # 5


# Polymorphism in Python is the ability of an object to take many forms.
# In simple words, polymorphism allows us to perform the same action in many different ways.
#
# For example, Jessa acts as an employee when she is at the office. However, when she is at home,
# she acts like a wife. Also, she represents herself differently in different places.
#  Therefore, the same person takes different forms as per the situation.
#
# In polymorphism, a method can process objects differently depending on the class type or data type.


# example : +  operator.
Name = 'Vinay'
print('My name is ' + Name)
x1 = [1,3,5,7]
x2 = [2,4,6]
print(x1 + x2)

print(2 + 5)
# My name is Vinay
# [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6]
# 7
