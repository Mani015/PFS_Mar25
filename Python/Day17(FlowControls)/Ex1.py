# Conditional statements
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false.
#  You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition.
#  Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.

# There are three types of conditional statements.

# if statement
# if-else
# if-elif-else
# nested if-else



# If statement in Python
# In control statements, The if statement is the simplest form.
# It takes a condition and evaluates to either True or False.


# syntax : 

# if condition:
# 	statement...1
# 	statement...2
# 	statement...N


x = True

# if x:
#     print('Body of If')

# print('Next line')

# Body of If
# Next line



# If â€“ else statement
# The if-else statement checks the condition and executes the if block of code when the condition is True,
# and if the condition is False, it will execute the else block of code.

y = False

if y:
	print('body of if')


else:
	print('body of else')

print('Next line')


# body of else
# Next line
