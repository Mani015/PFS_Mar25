# What is function ?
# In python, the function is a block of code defined with a name

# Why use ?
# Do perform the  same task multiple times without writing the same code again.

# In python there are two types of functions
# 1.Pre-defined functions
# 2.User-defined functions


# 1.Pre-defined functions
# Those functions are comes by defaultly install python into your machince, such type functions are called in-built function
# Example : max(),min(),len(),sum(),eval(),input(),print()



# 2.User-defined functions
# In python, functions are the first class citizens (objects)
# user defined function with 'def'   keyword


# syntax : 

# def FunctionName():
# 	statement.....1
# 	statement.....2
# 	statement.....3
# 	statement......N

# FunctionName()

# What is PEP?
# PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) rules, especially PEP 8, 
# provide guidelines for writing readable and consistent Python code


# Key aspects of PEP 8:
# Indentation: Use 4 spaces for each indentation level. 
# Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters. 
# Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, improving visual structure. 
# Docstrings: Use docstrings (triple-quoted strings) to document functions, classes, and modules. 
# Naming Conventions:
# Use lowercase letters for variables, functions, and module names, with words separated by underscores (e.g., my_variable, calculate_area). 
# Use uppercase letters for constants (e.g., PI = 3.14159). 
# Avoid single-character names that could be confused with numbers (e.g., l, O, I). 
# Readability: Focus on writing code that is easy for others to understand and maintain. 
# Comments: Add comments to explain complex logic, but avoid redundant or overly verbose comments.
