# Greater than > : if you compared two operands when the X is Greater than Y ,it returns True

x = 12
y = 10

# In words, 12 is greater than 10
print(x > y) # True


# False : when X is less than the Y 
# print(y > x) False


# Lessthan < : here, compared both x and y(Which one is less than), if in case x is less than the y it returns True, otherwise False.

# print(-3 < 10) True

# print(-5 < -3) True



# print(-3 < -5) False

# When the X is not lessthan or not greater than the X, X is equals to be X
# print(3 < 3)  False

# print(-4 > -4) False
