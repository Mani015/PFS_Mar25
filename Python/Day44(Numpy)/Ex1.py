# What is need numpy?
# By using python we can perform basic operations
# like : Addition, subtraction, multiplication ........

# As the Part of perform statistics solving the complex operations
# [Linear operation, Integration,Algebra, Trigonometry] , python doesn't  support that case we have import
# Third-party libraries is numpy

# Data Science ,Machine Learning, deep learning  Extensisons  ---> Pandas, Matplot, numpy


# Features :
# Numpy is a super fast written in C.
# Numpy acts as backbone for Data Science Librabries like pandas, scipy
# Pandas internally used ndarray to store data, which is numpy data structure.
# has vectorization feature which improves performance while iterating elements.


# Array : Array is indexed collection of homogenous elements.

# How to install numpy
# Command is : pip install numpy


import  numpy as np

n1 = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
print(n1)
print(type(n1))
# [1 2 3 4 5]
# <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
